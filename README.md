## Inspiration
The idea for Chicken Learn came from my passion for making learning engaging and fun. I wanted to create a platform that combines educational content with interactive 3D elements and animations to capture the interest of users, especially children.

## What it does
Chicken Learn is a fun, interactive website featuring 3D elements and engaging animations designed to help users learn new words. The interface is user-friendly, allowing for an immersive learning experience that makes vocabulary building enjoyable.

## How we built it
The project was built using Svelte for the front-end, which allowed for efficient component management and reactive programming. We integrated 3D elements using Spline, providing a visually appealing interface. The animations were crafted using CSS, enhancing the user experience and making interactions more lively.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the main challenges was ensuring that the 3D elements and animations did not hinder the website's performance, especially on mobile devices. Balancing visual appeal with functionality required careful optimization. Additionally, coordinating the different components and ensuring seamless transitions was initially complex.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully created an interactive platform that not only looks great but also effectively teaches users new vocabulary. The integration of 3D visuals and animations received positive feedback during testing, showcasing the potential of combining education with entertainment.

## What we learned
Throughout this project, I learned the importance of optimizing web performance when incorporating complex elements like 3D graphics. Additionally, I gained experience in using Svelte and CSS animations, enhancing my skill set in web development.

## What's next for Chicken Learn
In the future, we plan to expand Chicken Learn by adding more interactive lessons, incorporating gamification elements to encourage regular use, and exploring different educational topics beyond vocabulary. We're also considering user feedback to make iterative improvements to the platform.
